# EwCode
The most disgusting programming language!
## Usage
1. Write some code
2. Save the code as a `.ecr` file
3. Compile and run the code using `ewcode "<your ecr file>"` . Replace `<your ecr file>` with the name of the file you stored the your code in. This should generate a file with the same name, but with the `.ewc` extension. **Example:** `ewcode "test.ecr"` -> `test.ewc`
