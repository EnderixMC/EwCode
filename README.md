# EwCode
The most disgusting programming language!
## Annoyances
 - Built-in lag
 - Wierd syntax
 - Poorly documented
## TODO
| Task | Status | Finished |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Improve import system | Finished | <ul><li>[x] Don't make modules recreate Command class</li></ul> |
| Test EwCode on multiple platforms | In progress | <ul><li>[x] Windows</li><li>[ ] Mac</li><li>[ ] Linux</li></ul> |
| Create built-in modules | In progress | <ul><li>[x] Make imports search in modules directory as well</li><li>[ ] Write some built-in modules</li></ul> |

## Usage
1. Write some code
2. Save the code as a `.ecr` file
3. Compile the code using `ewcode --compile "<your ecr file>"` . Replace `<your ecr file>` with the name of the file you stored the your code in. This should generate a file with the same name, but with the `.ewc` extension. **Example:** `ewcode --compile "test.ecr"` -> `test.ewc`
4. Run the `.ewc` file using `ewcode "<your ewc file>"` . Replace `<your ewc file>` with the name of the file that was generated by the last step. **Example:** `ewcode "test.ewc"`
